My First Java CLI Project

This is my first small Command Line Interface (CLI) project using Java. The goal of this project is to learn and practice the basic syntax of Java, including input handling, arrays, loops, and conditional statements. It's a simple yet meaningful step towards my journey in becoming a Java engineer.
Project Overview

The program asks the user to input their favorite programming language from a list of options. It then responds with a personalized message based on the user's choice, showcasing basic input handling and control flow in Java.
Features:

    Array Usage: Display a list of programming languages using arrays.
    User Input Handling: Accept user input via the terminal.
    Control Flow: Use if statements, loops, and switch cases to handle different conditions.
    Error Handling: Gracefully manage incorrect inputs using try-catch blocks.

Technologies Used

    Java: The project is built entirely using Java, focusing on the fundamentals of the language.

How to Run the Project

    Compile the Code: Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and compile the Java file:

    bash

javac Main.java

Run the Compiled Code: Execute the program using:

bash

    java Main

    Follow the On-Screen Instructions: The program will display a list of programming languages. Enter the number corresponding to your favorite language and receive a customized response.

What I Learned

    Java Basics: This project reinforced basic Java syntax, including variable declaration, loops, and conditionals.
    Arrays: I learned how to work with arrays to store and display data.
    User Input: I explored how to use the Scanner class to receive user input in a CLI application.
    Error Handling: I gained experience handling exceptions to make the program more robust.

My Journey

This project represents my first steps into the world of Java programming. Itâ€™s a simple application, but it embodies the foundational skills needed to build more complex projects in the future. I see this as a stepping stone towards a potential career as a Java engineer, where I can develop larger and more impactful applications.
Next Steps

    Continue learning more advanced Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
    Build more complex projects to solidify my understanding and broaden my skills.
    Explore Java frameworks and libraries to further enhance my projects.
